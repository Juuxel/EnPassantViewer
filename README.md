A viewer for Proguard obfuscation maps. Also supports directly importing
Mojang's mapping data for Minecraft, as well as composing it with other
open-source Minecraft mappings (Fabric's intermediary mappings and Yarn).

## Why call it "En Passant Viewer"?

The name is a reference to my Gradle plugin, [En Passant](https://github.com/CottonMC/EnPassant/),
which is a reference to the chess names used in Minecraft's world generation code.
